Be honest and sincere, especially with yourself\n\n4. Share and care about humans, animals and the rest of the nature\n\n5. Build opensource Web3.0 products and communities, that is the only tool\n\n6. Never get arrogant or selfish, it will destroy you from inside\n\n7. Learn to control your dark side, to stay on the light\n\n8. Have fun and bring value to the community. Rewards will follow\n\n9. The one and only true incentives system is a retrospective one\n\n10.

Allow yourself to be weak sometimes, but learn to keep your body and mind fit\n\n13. Let your ideas lighten your destiny and your path, that way will lead you to the happiness\n\n14.
