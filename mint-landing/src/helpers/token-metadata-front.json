Share and care about humans, animals, and the rest of the nature\n\n5.  Build open-source Web3.0 products and communities, that is the only tool\n\n6.  Never get arrogant or selfish, it will destroy you from inside\n\n7.  Learn to control your dark side, to stay on the light\n\n8.  Have fun and bring value to the community.
